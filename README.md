# CLItool
I have made a tool that converts a CSV file to a JSON one. It will parse all CSV rows from a file into a JSON array and output the result into a .json file. Each data cell will be parsed as a string datatype. The tools gives two options:
1)pretty: if enabled, it will create a well-formatted JSON file instead of a compact one (one single line)
2)separator: to indicate which character is used to separate cells. Only accepted options are comma(default) or semicolon.
(I took some online references to make this project)
